Tips and Tricks for Competitive Programming

> Problems where we perform operations on ranges (like adding on a range) 
	> Minimum operations needed to make everything equal:
		> Greedily move left to right.

> Cyclic shifts
	> Append the array to itself.

> For weird questions try something with fixing indexing at 0 or n-1 and perform operations then 

> DP
	> Try dp on ranges.
	> Try dp with ranges with some easy coefficient as constant.

> for questions relating to gcd(a[i],a[j])
	> mobius inversion (need to find x but find x' | x).

> look for invariants
	> maybe xor remains the same all the time.
